# Personal dotfiles

Personal dotfiles, using [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage dotfiles.

> Dotbot is an amazing tool, it's both lightweight and powerful. I like its design philosophy. You could manage your dotfiles in a direct way, and use it to link files conveniently. It does less than you think, your dotfiles are still under your control. You could go back to pure shell install scripts easily if you like.

If you want to manage your dotfiles with Dotbot too, you could refer to [the quickstart guide](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#getting-started) for more details.

## Installation

Clone the repo, then run `install` script to automatically set up the environment, it's idempotent (Feel free to run it multiple times).

## Local configurations

You can make local customizations for some applications by these files:

- bash: `~/.bashrc_local`
- zsh: `~/.zshrc_local`
- git: `~/.gitconfig_local`
